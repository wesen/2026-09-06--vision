# # Worker Safety in a Classical Warehouse
# ### Using Cosmos-Reason2
# ### [Main recipe](inference.md)
#
# ![Worker safety overview](assets/assets_1_worker_safety.png)

# %% [markdown]
# This notebook implements a complete Zero-Shot Video Reasoning Pipeline for industrial safety compliance. It demonstrates how to use NVIDIA Cosmos Reason 2, a multimodal Video Language Model (VLM), to act as an automated safety inspector in challenging "brownfield" environments.
#
# Unlike modern, pristine factories, "classical" warehouses often feature faded floor markings, irregular lighting, and worn infrastructure. Standard computer vision models often struggle here, confusing environmental noise with hazards. In this workflow, we solve this by using Context-Aware Prompt Engineering to force the model to ignore the background and focus strictly on specific visual ground truths.

    You are an expert Industrial Safety Inspector monitoring a manufacturing facility.
    Your goal is to classify the video into EXACTLY ONE of the 8 classes defined below.

    CRITICAL NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS (What to IGNORE):
    1. IGNORE SITTING WORKERS:
       - If a person is SITTING at a machine board working, this is NOT an intervention class. Ignore them.
       - If a person is SITTING driving a forklift, the driver is NOT the class. Focus only on the LOAD carried.
    2. IGNORE BACKGROUND:
       - The facility is old. Do not report hazards based on faded floor markings or unpainted areas.
    3. SINGLE OUTPUT:
       - Even if multiple things happen, choose the MOST PROMINENT behavior.
       - Prioritize UNSAFE behaviors over SAFE behaviors if both are present.
"""

USER_PROMPT_CONTENT = """
    Analyze the video and output a JSON object. You MUST select the class ID and Label EXACTLY from the table below.

    STRICT CLASSIFICATION TABLE (Use these exact IDs and Labels):

    | ID | Label | Definition (Ground Truth) | Hazard Status |
    | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
    | 0 | Safe Walkway Violation | Worker walks OUTSIDE the designated Green Path. | TRUE (Unsafe) |
    | 4 | Safe Walkway | Worker walks INSIDE the designated Green Path. | FALSE (Safe) |
    | 1 | Unauthorized Intervention | Worker interacts with machine board WITHOUT a green vest. | TRUE (Unsafe) |
    | 5 | Authorized Intervention | Worker interacts with machine board WITH a green vest. | FALSE (Safe) |
    | 2 | Opened Panel Cover | Machine panel cover is left OPEN after intervention. | TRUE (Unsafe) |
    | 6 | Closed Panel Cover | Machine panel cover is CLOSED after intervention. | FALSE (Safe) |
    | 3 | Carrying Overload with Forklift | Forklift carries 3 OR MORE blocks. | TRUE (Unsafe) |
    | 7 | Safe Carrying | Forklift carries 2 OR FEWER blocks. | FALSE (Safe) |


    INSTRUCTIONS:
    1. Identify the behavior in the video.
    2. Match it to one row in the table above.
    3. Output the exact "ID" and "Label" from that row. Do not invent new labels like "safe and compliant".
