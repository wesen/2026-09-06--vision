# Diary

## Goal

Record evidence, design decisions, implementation-task decomposition, and reMarkable delivery for VIDEO-TEMPORAL-001. This ticket is a design deliverable now; application implementation remains open.

## Step 1: Establish the project boundary

Created this child of COSMOS-VIDEO-001 and inspected the existing generator, validated corpus, teaching labs, and umbrella guide. The project scope is: Compare temporal decoders and store availability-aware facts without inventing missing steps. Dependencies are VIDEO-SEARCH-001, VIDEO-STATE-001.

### Prompt Context

**User prompt (verbatim):** "Ok, create the tickets, and Create  a detailed analysis / design / implementation guide that is for a new intern, explaining all the parts of the system needed to understand what it is, with prose paragraphs and bullet point sand pseudocode and diagrams and api references and file references. It should be very clear and technical. Store in the ticket and the nupload to remarkable."

**User prompt (verbatim):** "for each"

**User prompt (verbatim):** "use virtual home instead of habitat btw"

**Assistant interpretation:** Create a separate technical intern guide and executable task breakdown for every project; use VirtualHome for synthetic data.

**Inferred user intent:** Make each project independently understandable, reviewable, and ready for an intern to implement.

### What I did
- Created ticket, guide document, diary, and explicit dependency boundary with docmgr.
- Inspected `src/virtualhome_corpus/core.py`, `runner.py`, the checked configuration, and the corpus inventory.

### Why
- The umbrella checklist is too broad to assign or verify without project-level contracts and acceptance gates.

### What worked
- Existing 24-episode corpus and teaching code provide concrete inputs and API examples.

### What didn't work
- No ticket-creation failure occurred. Runtime APIs are references to verify at implementation time, not measured local model support.

### What I learned
- Current corpus timing is weak supervision; endpoint simulator truth must not become certified pixel labels.

### What was tricky to build
- Avoiding circular dependencies requires shared schema ownership and oracle fixtures before model integration.

### What warrants a second pair of eyes
- Scope boundaries and whether acceptance gates depend on evidence the present corpus cannot provide.

### What should be done in the future
- Complete the project-specific guide, validate its examples and PDF, upload it, then implement the open tasks in phase order.

### Code review instructions
- Read the guide alongside the umbrella corpus report; distinguish existing files from proposed modules.

### Technical details
- Parent: COSMOS-VIDEO-001.
- Simulator selection: VirtualHome, explicitly requested by the user.

## Step 2: Write the intern guide and implementation phases

Wrote the project-specific analysis, proposed contracts, data flow, decision records, implementation phases, test strategy, and review exercise. The guide explains compare temporal decoders and store availability-aware facts without inventing missing steps. It distinguishes the working VirtualHome generator from future workbench modules and keeps the current corpus's label limits explicit.

### Prompt Context
**User prompt (verbatim):** (see Step 1)

**Assistant interpretation:** Make this project independently understandable and implementable by a new intern.

**Inferred user intent:** Receive a technical design with enough detail to assign and review concrete work.

### What I did
- Authored the dedicated guide and phased task list in this ticket.
- Added direct local file references and linked dependency tickets.
- Validated code-fence balance, JSON examples, Python pseudocode syntax, SQL schema where present, and existing local links using umbrella `scripts/14-validate-project-guides.py`.
- Reviewed shared feature identity, time, evidence, and split contracts across all eight guides.

### Why
- Separate projects need compatible contracts and explicit data-quality gates to avoid duplicate implementations and misleading evaluation.

### What worked
- Every guide passed structural/example/link validation. The checks validate documentation syntax and references, not the future application.
- Existing file references point to real generator/config/playbook files; proposed workbench paths are clearly identified.

### What didn't work
- The web fetch for a guessed MLX-VLM embedding directory returned `Cache miss`. The design uses the verified maintainer README and requires inspection of the pinned installed entry point instead of inventing an API.
- No documentation parser or local-link validation failure occurred.

### What I learned
- Runtime support listings establish candidates, not measured local video behavior.
- Calibration and reviewed visibility are dependencies for stronger temporal claims, even when corpus media integrity passes.

### What was tricky to build
- A verifier's evidence cutoff and result availability are different clocks. The rules design preserves the cutoff but reevaluates at the later result time; it does not backdate new proposals.
- Multiple projects share schemas. The ticket map assigns ownership and allows oracle fixtures before full model integration.

### What warrants a second pair of eyes
- The project-specific acceptance gates and any claim relying on weak simulator timing.
- Vendor signatures and conversion fidelity must be checked again when actual runtimes are installed.

### What should be done in the future
- Render and inspect this guide, upload its own reMarkable edition, then execute the unchecked implementation phases.

### Code review instructions
- Read this ticket's guide and tasks, then follow direct dependency links.
- Run the umbrella guide-validation script to check examples and file references after editing.

### Technical details
- Guide: `design-doc/01-intern-analysis-design-and-implementation-guide.md`.
- Simulator: VirtualHome only for the active synthetic-data plan.
